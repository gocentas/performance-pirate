Going from the seed stage to series B taught me a couple of lessons.

I was hands-on the entire time. More first, less so afterwards.

Never had to manage people before, but now I did. Still didn't have to do a lot of the managerial stuff initially as there was a lot of help from HR and my direct manager with that.


The title tells only 10% of the story.

I led a team of 5 (incl. myself) and most of my team's work was in supporting other teams with whatever they needed to run campaigns and achieve their goals. Things like:

- Content management and editing
- Ad creative research and production
- Overseeing video production
- Writing and reviewing web copy
- Implementing marketing analytics
- Newsletter and email sequence management
- Production of various other design assets
- Launching and overseeing ad campaigns
- Taking care of multiple product marketing functions

On top of that I was also plugging some holes in the ship's hull hands-on where we had no dedicated resources.

If one were to fit this in a proper structure, the role was closest that of a Content and Creative Manager.

But the cross-functional add-ons made it more of a Marketing Janitor. :)
