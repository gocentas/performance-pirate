## Create separate posts for productivity and other tools?
## Also consider a post for tool combos where 1 + 1 = 3 or even more (something like Bardeen + ChatGPT for analysis)

No referral links below in case you wondered. These are the tools that I use and love. Most of them with a free version. :)

## Productivity
\

* [Meistertask](https://www.meistertask.com/) - for daily to-do lists, checklists, shopping lists and the rest.
* [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) - for long term goals, weekly activity lists, long term project planning.
* [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) - for tracking my time with least friction. I don't plan where I will spend every minute, but I track it to see where I can improve.

## Note taking
\

* [Hobonichi Techo planner](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2019/pc/detail_cover/pb19_jan.html) - random notes, thoughts, plans and an occasional to-do. It's the place I put my wandering mind into to avoid 100s of post-it notes.
* [Atom with org-mode package](https://atom.io/packages/org-mode) - for taking notes in a simple way and keeping them locally. Not perfect by any means, but various in-text markdown should stand the test of time.

### To be continued.
