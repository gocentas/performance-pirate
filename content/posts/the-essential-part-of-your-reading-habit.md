Do you read books the same way many people go to the gym?

That is, with a focus on *looking good* and *doing something*, not seeking functional improvement?

I caught myself doing exactly that sometime in the second part of 2018. And, to a certain point, that was perfectly fine. If I obsessed over the next read when my goal was to create a daily reading habit - I might have never developed the habit at all.

## With the reading habit in place, I noticed I’m underutilizing it. You might be too.
\
I was reading non-fiction on topics I’m interested in, getting my brain moving in the process like one would get the body moving in the gym. And it was a good start, don’t get me wrong, but the potential is bigger.

Just like functional fitness focuses on improving the strength and mobility required for the daily tasks one can focus the reading on functional improvement of everyday life.

How do you do that?

Before every book ask yourself what challenges are you currently dealing with. Are there key areas lacking in personal improvement?

## Ask yourself WHY this book? WHY now?
\
You will be quick to discover that these questions lead to great outcomes.

At the very least it will become easier to choose the next book out of the plethora of options in your reading list.

You will start using what you read immediately. This will lead to clarity in life, serenity at home and better results at work. You will retain more of what you read for the future. You will know which book to grab for a quick recap when a familiar problem comes along.

### Get better. Read with a goal in mind.
