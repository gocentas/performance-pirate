This is a growing list of tools that I've tested in one of the experiments or otherwise use for routine tasks.

None of the links here are affiliate or somehow incentivized. I believe that anyone aiming to do a thorough and objective review should not be influenced by payment of some sort.

## The list (sorted alphabetically):

-   [Bardeen](https://www.bardeen.ai/) -- an automation setup tool for various other applications. Also a nice and easy way to get into data scraping.
-   [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) -- a builder for single-page websites. When you want to create something quickly for validation or just don't want the hassle.
-   [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) -- the best known chatbot based on a large language model. You've likely heard about it by now. 
-   [Descript](https://descript.com/) -- an easy-to-use video editor with automatic transcription, voice dubbing, and other nice features. Has its quirks, but well worth a try if you want to cut down on editing time.\

-   [Draftable](https://draftable.com/) -- a tool that does side-by-side document comparison. The nice part is (at the time of use) -- you don't even have to sign up to use it.\

-   [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/) -- a chatbot based on a large language model built by Google. Formerly notorious for its hallucination rate.
-   [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/) -- AI image generator. Arguably the best one on the market right now.
-   [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) -- an open source screen recording tool. I think it also does streaming and maybe even more than that, but haven't had the need for that. If you have Descript (mentioned above), this is likely redundant.
-   [Pro Writing Aid](https://prowritingaid.com/) -- text editing and correction tool. Similar to Grammarly, just better insights and has a usable free version.\
    Used in: [Experiment 1](/post/placeholder-to-measure-things)
-   [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) -- an AI experiment from Google that plays on the concept of AI for songwriting. Coincidentally, it's also interesting to tinker with for copywriting and wordplay for that.

Of course, there's also stuff everyone knows, like Google Docs, but it's not like you came here to read about that.

If you'd like to chat about how to apply any of these in the work you do -- [book a 30 minute call](https://calendly.com/gocentas/intro?utm_source=performance-pirate&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=sound-like-a-robot) with me and let's talk it through. No strings attached.
