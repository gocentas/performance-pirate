## Make this a general post about productivity books
## Then make another about marketing books
## And a post about learning AI-related stuff, but not limited to books

A great book read at the wrong time is less useful than a mediocre book read at the right time.

As of 2018 reading became a part of my morning routine. This lead to picking what I read differently. Previously a catchy title, some good reviews and an interesting topic was enough to seduce me into reading something. Now - no more.

It struck me that reading non-fiction only holds value if you implement the advice when you need it. It's most effective to implement it as you go. This lead to picking the books I read in a different way. Is there a challenge in my life I can solve with this advice right now became the key question. Yes? Let's read it.

Here are the books that made the most lasting changes to my life:

## The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy:
I read this over 10 years ago, as someone that has just understood that wishful thinking isn't going to get me all that far by itself. I set out goals for myself all the time. Failed to reach them or keep up on trying to get them. This was the book that calmed me down. It got this idea that whatever small bit of action I take towards my goals on a given day it's more than nothing.

All of this small action adds up and eventually gets you somewhere you worked towards. This idea has been what pulled me out of procrastination, burnout and crappy life phases over and over again. *I have done nothing towards my goals today* became unacceptable. Doing a little bit of something, anything at all, was such a low barrier to keep jumping over that I had no excuse for that. Tackling just a little bit usually lead to doing some more than originally intended. This in turn put me over the hurdles and into a better mood.

A simple idea that will get you moving from ground zero.

## How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life by Alan Lakein
Setting prioritized tasks goals daily and knowing where I'm going in life has been the most recent revelation. This is an old book that explains powerful time management techniques. I had been writing daily to do lists for nearly a year when I read this.

While to do lists certainly helped to stay on track and keep moving forward, they didn't ensure I work on the right things. It's funny, but you can procrastinate by doing the stuff on your to do lists. I would set my tasks for the next day. On the next day I would start with whatever I felt like doing just to *get myself moving*. Then I continued with tasks that I knew weren't exactly of highest importance or benefit to me. Then it was already too late to make the important phone call or something else and at the end of the day my to do list was mostly checked off, but I felt like I haven't done anything.

### Here are my top reads of 2018 and why:
1. *How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life* by Alan Lakein \
I noticed my to-do lists were lacking. The simple idea of prioritizing every task and aligning it with key goals in life is liberating. I will write another post about planning for peace and effectiveness.
2. *Miracle Morning for Entrepreneurs* by Hal Elrod and Cameron Herold \
I was seeking better routines and this book gave me those.
3. *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat* \
I love to make and eat tasty food, but the geek in me just had to understand the science behind it. Samin delivers and the illustrations are gorgeous!
4. *Everybody Writes by Ann Handley* \
I understood I lacked systems and a good all-around understanding in my writing. Be it direct response copy or a blog post. I now refer to this book constantly.
5. *The Brain Audit* by Sean D’Souza \
There are marketing books that tell you to do something in a certain way. And then there are marketing books that drill into the true medium we marketers are operating in - the human mind. This is the latter. It’s a great read when you need to fill the gaps of WHY? in your understanding.

### Other books I enjoyed during 2018:

* *The Flavour Bible* by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg
