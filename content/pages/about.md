When life gives you a tech tsunami about to wash your job away, it's time to learn to surf.

Good day, creative mastermind! ðŸ‘‹

As a marketer, you inevitably began to look for where the AI tool hype stems from. Unfortunately, the dots of possibilities donâ€™t immediately connect. You have to immerse yourself in it.

Unfortunately, you don't necessarily have the privilege of doing this. You need to drive results now. Thereâ€™s no room for error, no room for fiddling with tech that may not work for you.

This is exactly the reason why I set aside time every day to learn whatâ€™s coming, to experiment with it, to document it. And then share it, hoping it will help you cut a few tasks away and become a more efficient marketer by doing so.

## Is this for me?
If you match at least one of the conditions below, it likely is.

Youâ€™ve had enough of the high-level posts saying you can do it with AI without showing you how.

Youâ€™re struggling to understand if a given approach makes sense time-wise.

Youâ€™re worried that a given technology is going to replace you, but canâ€™t figure how close that is.

You want something hands-on, useful, and usable in the realm of using novel marketing tech.

You need ideas on how to actually adopt the tools in everyday marketing workflows.

## Is it free?
The advice is, but many of the tools I use might not be. The goal is not to be cheap, itâ€™s buying some time. To keep it genuine, I donâ€™t use any affiliate links on this website.

## Who are you?
Iâ€™m Raitis (pronounced *right is*). A proper marketing generalist who, at one time or the other, had to do most marketing functions there are.

This includes the visual (imagery, video, web), the written and spoken, the business side of generating leads, working at events, finding partnerships, building strategies, the technical part of setting up ads, web tracking, and email automation, and a plethora of other things that donâ€™t fall into any category.

As a result, I often work in early stage startups where one has to do most of the above. Itâ€™s interesting, but taxing.

In any marketing discipline, thereâ€™s never a lack of things to do, but once you have to do way more than one, youâ€™re at the state of constant trade-offs.

This is yet another reason why Iâ€™ve started looking into tools and techniques to get more done. So once youâ€™re ready, [head to the blog](https://performancepirate.com/posts/) and find a topic thatâ€™s closest to what you want to accomplish.
